<h1> Planning approaches in AI </h1>

<h2> Rule-Based Planning </h2> <br>
This approach involves defining a set of rules that describe the decision-making process. The rules are typically based on expert knowledge and can be used to make decisions based on specific input conditions.

<h2> Search-Based Planning </h2> <br>
This approach involves exploring a search space to identify the best sequence of actions to achieve a particular goal. The search space can be represented as a graph or a tree, and different algorithms can be used to traverse the space to find the optimal solution.

<h2> Optimization-Based Planning </h2> <br>
This approach involves using optimization techniques to find the best solution given certain constraints and objectives. This can involve using mathematical programming or other optimization techniques to identify the optimal plan.

<h2> Heuristic Planning </h2> <br>
This approach involves using heuristic algorithms to find a good solution in a reasonable amount of time. Heuristics are rules of thumb that can be used to guide the search for a solution.

<h2> Model-Based Planning </h2> <br>
The approach involves using a model of the world to simulate different scenarios and evaluate the performance of different plans. The model can be used to identify potential risks and uncertainties and to evaluate the potential impact of different decisions.

h2> Decision-Theoretic Planning </h2><br>
This approach involves using decision theory to make decisions in complex, uncertain environments. It involves modeling the decision-making process as a series of choices that are made based on probabilities and expected values.
