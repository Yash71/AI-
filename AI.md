<h1> Limits of AI </h1>

* Limited Understanding of Context <br>
AI systems typically operate within a specific domain and may struggle to understand the context outside of that domain. They may also struggle to understand nuances and subtle differences that humans can easily discern.

* Lack of Creativity <br>
While AI systems can generate novel solutions to problems, they lack the creativity and intuition that humans possess. They can only generate solutions based on the data they have been trained on and may struggle to come up with innovative ideas.

* Bias <br>
AI systems can be biased if they are trained on biased data. This can lead to discriminatory or unfair decisions and can perpetuate existing inequalities.

* Lack of Common Sense <br>
AI systems may struggle with tasks that require common sense knowledge or understanding of the world. They may not be able to make logical inferences based on incomplete or ambiguous information.

* Limited Explanation <br>
AI systems can be opaque, meaning that it may be difficult to understand how they arrived at a particular decision. This lack of transparency can make it difficult to trust or explain AI-driven decisions to stakeholders.
